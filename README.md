# WP Protector

This is a small plugin that only works on Linux systems.

The settings panel will allow you to *lock* some directories, where usually malwares and viruses try to add their own files.

Directories that can be locked are:

- themes
- plugins
- upload

By default, the plugin does not lock anything.

Hope it helps! :-)
