# OS3 WebSite Protector

This is a small plugin that only works on Linux systems.

This plugin allows to write protect special directories to avoid viruses and malwares to write into them.

The settings panel will allow you to *lock* some directories, where usually malwares and viruses try to add their own files.

Directories that can be locked are:

- themes
- plugins
- upload

By default, the plugin does not lock anything.

Hope it helps! :-)
